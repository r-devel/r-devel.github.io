# Collaboration Campfires

*Learn how to contribute to R!*

The Collaboration Campfires are online collaborative events to open pathways for members of groups currently underrepresented in the R project. The goal is to demystify the R development process and highlight ways that R programmers can contribute, with a focus on low-level contributions in terms of time commitment and prerequisite knowledge.

The current series is planned in the run-up to the useR! 2022 online conference, where we plan to hold a satellite global contribution event: the [Bug Barbecue](https://user2022.r-project.org/program/)!

The Collaboration Campfires will be on the 4th Tuesday of every month from February to May 2022. The 90 minute Zoom sessions will start at **15:30 UTC**. Note: many countries switch to daylight savings time either before the March meeting or before the April meeting.
