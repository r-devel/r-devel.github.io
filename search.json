This book is organized in levels:\n\n0 - Encounter: summarizes the very basics of programming with C.\n1 - Acquaintance: details most principal concepts and features such as control structures, data types, operators, and functions.\n2 - Cognition: goes to the heart of the C language, covering pointers, C’s memory model, and most of C’s library interface.\n3 - Experience: goes into detail about specific topics, such as performance, reentrancy, atomicity, threads, and type-generic programming.\n\nThis book club will cover levels 0 to 2 (about 200 pages).\nThe reading will be supplemented with:\n\nSelected exercises from C Programming: A Modern Approach by K. N. King (shared under fair use).\nThe chapter on R’s C interface from Advanced R (1st ed.) by Hadley Wickham (free online)."

Optional: Do “Problem Set” and submit if doing course for credit, or if you want to receive an automatic grade to check your progress\n\nThe additional practice problems are often harder than the problem set, however we suggest leaving the problem set till after the meetup and attempting this independently (this is expected if you are doing the course for credit).\nThere is the option to do further study towards a free certificate from Harvard or a verified certificate from edX (~200 USD, financial assistance program available on edX).

The first comment is the bug report itself. There maybe be further comments in reply, discussing the bug and potentially how to fix it.\n\n\n\nProposed patch\n ???\nSometimes there will be a proposed patch attached to the bug report.

The issues have been labelled to help you find bugs to work on. The labels that start with capital letters, e.g. Models or Documentation, describe the general topic of the bug. The labels in lower case describe required actions.

For more complex work on internal R functions or compiled code (e.g. involving the C code underlying much of base R), it will be necessary to build R to develop and test your patch. Refer to the R Development Guide for more information on building R from source and the lifecycle of a patch."
