# R Contributor Site

This is a site for people interested in contributing to R core - the code and documentation that gets distributed as base R.

Join our [Slack Group](slack) to chat with current and aspiring R contributors. Everyone interested is welcome!

Read the [R Development Guide](https://contributor.r-project.org/rdevguide){:target="_blank"}, follow a [Tutorial](tutorials), or attend and [Events](events) to learn more about how to contribute to R.

This site is maintained by the [R Contribution Working Group](working-group), which is working on initiatives to encourage wider contribution to R core. The working group is open to new members ([more information](working-group)).
